## Hi there 👋 This is Hailemariam.
### Software Engineer & Horticulturist!

## My Multidisciplinary Journey

I have a multidisciplinary profession with a background in Software Engineering, DevOps, Cloud and Horticulture. I began my career as a horticulturist and plant researcher, dedicated to improving plant varieties, ensuring crop resilience, and driving sustainable agricultural practices. After several years in plant research and sustainable agriculture, I saw firsthand how **technology could transform agriculture**. This inspired me to become information technologist and learn **IT Infrastructure**, **DevOps**, **Cloud** and **Software Engineering**. My passion is at the intersection of nature and technology—designing AI-driven smart, scalable and sustainable AgTech solutions for resilient food systems, green software infrastructure, and data-informed climate strategies.



Today, I bring together:
- 🧠 **Research rigor** from plant science  
- 💻 **Engineering discipline** from software development  
- ☁️ **Scalability and security** from DevOps and cloud systems  

My goal is to bridge the gap between **traditional horticulture** and **emerging technologies**, building tools that not only enhance crop yields and resource use but also align with **green software principles** and **climate resilience goals**.

I thrive in environments that need both **domain-specific knowledge** and **technical innovation**—from AI-enabled farming dashboards to sustainable cloud infrastructure for AgTech startups.
