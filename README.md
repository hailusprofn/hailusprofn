## My Multidisciplinary Journey

I began my career as a horticulturist and plant researcher, dedicated to improving plant varieties, ensuring crop resilience, and driving sustainable agricultural practices.

Over the years, I saw firsthand how **technology could transform agriculture**: from automated data collection to climate-responsive farming. This inspired me to pivot, retrain, and pursue a **Master’s in Software Engineering** while diving into **Cloud DevOps ** and modern **Python development**.

Today, I bring together:
- 🧠 **Research rigor** from plant science  
- 💻 **Engineering discipline** from software development  
- ☁️ **Scalability and security** from DevOps and cloud systems  

My goal is to bridge the gap between **traditional horticulture** and **emerging technologies**, building tools that not only enhance crop yields and resource use but also align with **green software principles** and **climate resilience goals**.

I thrive in environments that need both **domain-specific knowledge** and **technical innovation**—from AI-enabled farming dashboards to sustainable cloud infrastructure for AgTech startups.
